## About

We are developing an experimental online coding platform designed to scale on demand using serverless architecture. The platform also promnises a clean user experience and a fair and excellent judge. By using serverless functions, OpenFaaS, and Kubernetes, and other technologies the platform aims to provide a robust and scalable environment for competitive programming. This project involves building core functionalities such as code submission, execution, problem management, and leaderboard updates as serverless functions. The goal is to create a highly responsive and efficient system that can handle variable loads while providing a seamless user experience. This approach not only enhances scalability but also allows for a modular and maintainable architecture, making it an ideal solution for modern online coding challenges. Join us today and embark on your coding journey!

We invite guidance and suggestions in building this platform.

## Architecture

### Functions
The following functions will be implemented:
1. Fucntion to Submit Code
2. Function to Execute Code
3. Function to Manage Leaderboard in competitions
4. Function to Display User Statistic
5. Function to Authenticate User
6. Function to Submit Problem
7. Function to Diplay Problems
8. Function to Fetch a Problem

### Database
The database will be used for storing user data, problem statements, submission records, leaderboard statistics etc.

### Execution Environment
Sandboxing using docker containers for safe execution of user-submitted code. and adding resource limits.

### User interface
Currently we are building the platform to run on the terminal. Once the terminal version is ready, the future releases will have a cleaner and more usable front end.
